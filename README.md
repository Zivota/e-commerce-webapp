# Modern React e-commerce App

Fully functional dynamic React app with modern UI, made completely from scratch using React.js, SCSS, and React Router. For state management, I've used React Context API. This e-commerce store is selling watches, it has 7 different smart watches which all can be accessed individually for more information. App has an advanced cart, also made from scratch, which allows you to add or remove items from the cart, control the number of items, and dynamically calculate the total price of that single item. The checkout button will calculate the total price and give you the option of choosing different shipping methods which will also dynamically calculate the total price state. The basic design is downloaded from "Free HTML templates" but none of the code has been used, only images, from there I've built the rest of the app. Here you can check how the theme is looking: https://html.design/preview/?theme=timups. Note: My intention wasn't to copy the design perfectly, I've used it as a foundation to have something, to begin with, and build the rest of the app from there. Design is responsive on all devices, I've used CSS flex and CSS grid for styling. Also, in the future, I would like to add animations to single watch cards and testimonial cards as well as the menu, but currently, I was focused on React logic and pixel-perfect layout.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
